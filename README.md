    <p>Rak Buku is a web application to store reading books, we can add a new book and move books between shelves by marking them as "selesai dibaca (read)" or "belum selesai (unfinished)". We can also remove the book from the bookshelf by pressing the "hapus buku (delete book)" button and edit the book by pressing the edit icon.</p>
